### Micro Frontends

Micro Frontends is an architectural style where a front-end application is decomposed into smaller, more manageable pieces, often referred to as micro frontends. Each micro frontend is a self-contained unit responsible for a specific feature or functionality. Micro frontends allow teams to work independently on different parts of a web application, making it easier to scale development and deployment.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Independent Deployment:**
   Micro frontends can be developed, tested, and deployed independently of each other.

2. **Technology Agnostic:**
   Micro frontends can be built using different technologies and frameworks, allowing teams to choose the tools that best fit their needs.

3. **Isolation:**
   Micro frontends are isolated from each other, reducing the risk of one component affecting another.

4. **Integration:**
   There's a need for a mechanism to integrate these micro frontends into a cohesive user interface.
